Gentone is a music composition library for generating tree-based melodic
sequences using functional genetic programming.

## Experimenting

$ brew install leiningen
```

To run an experiment, use the ```simple-tune``` function.

```sh
$ lein repl

user=> (simple-tune 7 2 4 3 50)
```

## Testing

Unit testing is necessary for good workflow.

```sh
$ lein test
```
